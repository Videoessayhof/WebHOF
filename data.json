    "an unclear mystery. Video essays are largely undefinable, not because of the video formatting. Rather because of the confusion surrounding the term “essay”. Any attempt to define the term using a historical president is not only unclear but also contradictory. \nFor this archive, an “essay” will be defined in such a way as to capture the unique dynamics, culture, and utility of the term on the internet. In other words, not a universal definition, but the spirit of the term as it exists and is being used now. \nThe few commonalties for all essays in this archive are as follows:\n1.) Essays are nonfiction.\n2.) Essays are written for the benefit of the viewing audience to understand a subject  \n3.) Essays must be making a novel observation about and/or synthesizing information for greater understanding\n4.) Essays must be presented in an easily shareable video format (eg. A YouTube video) \n\nOur goal with this archive is to promote and further cultivate a quality of video that is believed to be best for the internet platforms, to develop a resource for people to expand their hobbies and develop their personal tastes. We wish to gather a den of rationality, artistic skill, genuine sentiment, and quality that can rival industry productions. And, on a more personal note, to preserve against the march of time and indifference of larger platforms that have failed to protect and promote the content we love. Videos presented here should be thorough with their exploration of a topic, knowledgeable in their subject, insightful, and civil in discourse. There is no specific limitation on subject matter, format, or structure so long as these criteria are met.": {

    "A Response Video or Debate:\n        This archive is not meant for online drama or debates. There are videos in the archive about these types of interactions, but there must be an attempt in the essay to separate oneself from the topic and act in an archivist, documentarian, or at least, neutral productive critical role. When giving commentary on a company, product, historic and public figures, or art piece there should be a degree of separation between the work being discussed and the personal lives of those involved with its creation. Directly attacking or responding to individuals rather then their arguments and political views contrasts with the values and goals of this archive.\n": {
